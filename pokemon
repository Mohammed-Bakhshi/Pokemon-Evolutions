# Pokemon Charizard    evaluation
I wanted to try out web scraping with a simple project, so I decided to focus on Pokemon. I extracted the evaluation and stats for Charizard and put them into a Panda data frame for easy reading. 



# How I did it 

* Imported all the packages I will be using and defined the URLs I will be using
* I made a list of collum names that I will be using for the panda data frame 
* I manifested an empty list to store the data for each Pokemon
* Looped through each URL
*  For each URL, I used request to get the HTML content.
*  Used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
*   Extracted the name of the Pokemon from the HTML using the `find_all()` method.
* Retrieved the Pokemon attributes such as species, height, weight, HP, attack, and defense from the HTML content using appropriate HTML tags and navigating through the structure.
*   Stored the extracted data for each Pokemon in a list.
*   Created a Pandas data frame from the collected data list and assigned column names.
*   Printed the DataFrame to display the extracted information in a structured format.
